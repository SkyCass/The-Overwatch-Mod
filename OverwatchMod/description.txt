This mod adds weapons from Overwatch to Terraria! 
(Formerly the Pulse Pistol Mod)

This mod adds:
2 New weapons
-Mcree's Peacekeeper Revolver, a hardmode gun crafted with Hallowed Bars
-Tracer's Pulse Pistol, a pre-hardmode gun rivaling the minishark.


(A simple recipe is added for converting Tungsten to Silver as Tracer's gun requires silver bullets.)

TO DO:
Add Sounds
Improve sprites
Fix muzzle/handle alignment
Add More Weapons (especially for other classes)
Add Accessories (such as Tracer's chronal accelerator)
Improve balance once more weapons are added
Possibly add minibosses such as Roadhog? Not quite sure.
